# Augur

Augur is a decentralized oracle and peer to peer protocol for prediction markets. Augur is free, public, open source software, portions of which are licensed under the General Public License \(GPL\) and portions of which are licensed under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\) license. Augur is a set of smart contracts written in Solidity that can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

Augur is a protocol, freely available for anyone to use however they please. Augur is accessible through a desktop client app, similar to interacting with an Ethereum or Bitcoin node. Users of the Augur protocol must themselves ensure that the actions they are performing are compliant with the laws in all applicable jurisdictions and must acknowledge that othersâ€™ use of the Augur protocol may not be compliant. Users of the Augur protocol do so at their own risk.



## Development Guides

Clone Augur's Monorepo.

* `git clone https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.git`

Then, install the packages using Yarn -- installation _must_ be done via `yarn` and not `npm` since Augur utilizes the Yarn Workspace funcitonality for monorepo support.

* `yarn`
